# Angry app

Have you ever had the experience of having the sense that you're made at someone, but can't remember why? Or that you had promised yourself to be mad at someone, but then completely forgot the next time you saw them? Angry app is a recreational project I undertook in 2017 to help an angry user remember who they're mad at, why they're mad at them, and how long they wanted to be angry at that person. Written in Python 3 it uses SQLite to create a database allowing the app to remember who the user is mad at (and why), as well as to make changes to the grievances.
